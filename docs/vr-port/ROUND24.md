# Round 24: from 2026-11-05, towards 1.1

A per-feature reference: current behaviour only. Earlier work: `ROUND23.md` (1.1.0-beta4 to 2026-11-05: 8,600 lines, grep it, never
read it whole), `ROUND22.md` (1.0.1 to beta4). Add new work as a short section per feature, or fold it into its section: what it does,
settings and defaults, files, tests, open issues. Keep sections short: this file is meant to stay small.

## Close two-hand grips: both hands stay where they gripped (branch `agent/cratebound`)

The grip fit of the second hand (`vr_carry2h.cpp`, `fitGrip`) moved its grip out of the prop but left the hand behind: the
grips' middle was then off the hands' middle, so `solve` shifted the prop and each hand sat half the move off its grip (the
first hand pulled along), and the grips' line was off the hands' line (a phantom turn, bigger the shorter the line). Now the
move is also the hand's `Hold::reach`, as a hand held out of a prop already was: at the grab's pose `solve` gives the prop
where it was. A grab with nothing to fit runs as before. When the first hand lets go, the prop jumps by the reach as it does
for a hand held out.

Test: `Misc/quakevr/crate_grip_test.sh <agent>`, `vr_carry2h_grip_test` (a small crate in both mock hands, a second of fixed
frames, each hand's largest distance from its grip, limit 0.5 cm; verdict line `vr_carry2h_grip_test: N passed, M failed`).
The bug reproduces in the mock:

| case | grips | before: each hand off its grip | now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| close, off hand beside the main | 17.8 cm | 0.70 cm (FAIL) | 0.03 cm |
| close, pushed 10 cm in | 17.8 cm | 0.70 cm (FAIL) | 0.03 cm |
| close, pushed in, keep-out off | 17.8 cm | 2.60 cm (FAIL) | 0.03 cm |
| wide, nothing to fit | 94 cm | 0.01 cm | 0.01 cm (the same) |
| wide, the fit moving the grip 23 cm | 94 cm | 11.75 cm (FAIL) | 0.01 cm |

The mock's hands themselves move 0.72 cm over that second, and the crate follows them (2.5 cm at its middle, before and after).
The test's first grab uses `vr_grip_fit_reach 3` (a spawned crate lands on the hand). Scene: `{test:crate_close_grip}`.

Not tested: the drawn hand in a real headset, or hands turning together in a close grip.

## A turned teleporter's exit: the body turned with the gate (branch `agent/cratebound`)

The body carried through a gate was met at the destination with the axis-aligned bound of its turned box: at 45 degrees 41%
wider each way, so a narrow exit the body fits blocked it. Now the destination half of a move (`portals::destHalf`, for
`VR_PortalBodyMove` and `VR_PortalReachMove`) sweeps the box itself, turned with the gate: `SV_MovePortalTurned`, then
`hull::clipPortal`'s `turned` and the sweep's `BoxTurn` (`vr_hull.cpp`). The bound still finds what is near. The box's corners
meet each brush's faces and bevels, and its own faces meet the brush's corners (`clipToTurnedFaces`, worked out only for a brush
its planes haven't missed, near such a gate). Right-angle turns take the old path, unchanged.

Still conservative, never through a wall: recovered clip brushes meet the bound; edge-against-edge axes are left out, so a sloped
edge can stop the box slightly early. A prop tossed through a gate keeps its bound (`toss`'s placement test).

Test: `Misc/quakevr/teleporters/turned_exit_test.sh <agent>` (vrteleporters' new room d45, west of T's west wall door: walks into
gates that come out at yaw 45 into free-standing corridors; verdict line `vr_portals_turned_test: N passed, M failed`). With the
old bound: the 28.3-wide exit stops the 16-unit body (FAIL, the player stays at the gate, 1 passed, 1 failed). Now: through it
and on; the 14.1-wide exit still stops him, his origin 8.4 units short of the gate's plane (2 passed, 0 failed).
`teleporters_test.sh walk` on the new code: `turn45` crosses both ways, and the other gates cross or stop as the map intends (no
run of the old code to compare line by line). Open, from the box sizes and not tested: once carried the body is axial again and
needs 22.6 across a 45-degree corridor, so an exit between 16 and 22.6 wide passes the gate's test and may stop or stick him just
past it.
