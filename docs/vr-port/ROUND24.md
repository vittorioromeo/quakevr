# Round 24: from 2026-11-05, towards 1.1

A per-feature reference: current behaviour only. Earlier work: `ROUND23.md` (1.1.0-beta4 to 2026-11-05: 8,600 lines, grep it, never
read it whole), `ROUND22.md` (1.0.1 to beta4). Add new work as a short section per feature, or fold it into its section: what it does,
settings and defaults, files, tests, open issues. Keep sections short: this file is meant to stay small.

## Magnetic holster chain on fast swings

The backlog's "worst piece 78 %" was a squeeze, not a stretch: on the fast swing the longest piece was 15.7 % over, the
shortest 78 % under. A hand at 5-8 m/s moves the pinned end most of a piece's length a frame, and the pull-only
`holdLengths` has nothing to push the next point away, so the end runs into it and the pieces bunch (why more iterations
never helped). Second cause: the drawn gun's weight spring snaps back (`vr_weight_spring_snap`), a 60 cm jump in a frame,
and the tether's jump check restarted it dead straight, each piece 12 % short at 65 cm (more closer in) with nothing to
bend them out of the line.

- `verlet::limitPieces` (`vr_verlet.cpp`): after `holdLengths`, each piece kept within `vr_magholster_chain_limit` (0.1,
  0: off; Immersion > Magnetic Holsters > Chain Physics, "Chain Piece Limit"). Up to 3 rounds of a pass from the weapon
  back and one from the holster on, each point moved only to its neighbour's limit, `prev` with it (no speed from it, so
  no energy in); it stops at the first round that moves nothing. A chain within its limits is not touched. Points lying
  on the world are left to the collision (limited too, the corner case's worst piece went from 43 % to 122 %). The tether
  only: the grappling rope and the AD hose are unchanged.
- `hangAfresh` (`vr_magholster.cpp`): a tether started afresh hangs in a parabola of its length, its points even along it,
  stopped by the world below the line.

Test: `Misc/quakevr/magchain_stretch_test.sh <agent>` (`RATE=72` for 72 Hz): slow, fast and whipped moves, the limit off
then on, verdict `magchain_stretch: ... PASS`. `vr_magholster_chain_log` also prints a `magpiece` line per step (stretch,
squeeze, sag). Worst piece on fast swings, limit off / on: 78.0 / 10.0 % at 90 Hz, 78.1 / 10.0 % at 72 Hz (78.0 before any
change too); the slow swing's sag differs by 0.0 mm at both; jerk p95 31 / 30 mm; 0 not finite. The tether's step 0.009 ms
either way (no-LTO exe, ratio only). `magchain_test.sh`: fast tether 78 -> 10 %, slow 2.5 % and fast jerk p95 27.7 mm as
before; jerk max 220 -> 300 mm, on the gun's snap frame. `magchain_sim_test.sh`: 0 pieces through the world; worst piece
the same with the limit on and off: corner 43 %, floor 94 % (a chain lying on the world, not limited).

Open: the lanyard is a spring cord, not this chain: 16.7 % on the same fast swing, untouched. A chain dragged along the
world on a fast swing is not limited where it touches.
