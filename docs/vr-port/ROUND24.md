# Round 24: from 2026-11-05, towards 1.1

A per-feature reference: current behaviour only. Earlier work: `ROUND23.md` (1.1.0-beta4 to 2026-11-05: 8,600 lines, grep it, never
read it whole), `ROUND22.md` (1.0.1 to beta4). Add new work as a short section per feature, or fold it into its section: what it does,
settings and defaults, files, tests, open issues. Keep sections short: this file is meant to stay small.

## Flatscreen: the stance, replacing the barrel rest

A long gun with a two-handed hotspot turns the torso (free hand's shoulder forward), brings the gun's hand towards the shoulder pocket,
and draws the free hand on the weapon's own hotspot from Weapon Offsets, through the code that draws a helping hand in a headset. A
look: no grip, aim, weight or recoil. `vr_flat_stance` 1, `vr_flat_stance_turn` 25, `_back` 10, `_in` 2, `_up` 4; `vr_flat_rest*` retired.
Details and measures: FLATPLAY.md, "The stance". Files: `vr_flatsight.cpp` (`stanceAndLook`), `vr_flatplay.cpp`, `vr_view_hands.cpp`
(`setupHand`, `steadyOther`), `vr_view_diag.cpp` (`twoHandSpot`), `vr_twohand.cpp` (`drawnTransition`, `drawnHelping`). Test:
`Misc/quakevr/flatstance_test.sh`, including that editing a hotspot moves and turns the flat hand. Open: in the ironsight at eye relief
14 the arm can't reach the hotspot on the guns without a real grip, so the hand hangs there.
