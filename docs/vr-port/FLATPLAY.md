# Flatscreen play (`-flatscreenmode`)

Quake VR's gameplay played on the desktop screen, with no headset. Everything here is behind the command-line flag
`-flatscreenmode` and only while there is no headset session (`VR_IsActive() == 0`) — and the flag implies no session
(see below). Start the game without the flag and none of it happens.

Engine side: `Quake/vr/vr_flatplay.cpp`. Game-code side: `QC/vr_util.qc` (`VR_FlatPlay`), `QC/weapons.qc`,
`QC/vr_wpnforcegrab.qc`.

## Turning it on

    ironwail.exe -flatscreenmode

**`-flatscreenmode` implies no VR backend.** The mode runs only while no headset session is up, so the flag is what asks
for no backend at all: no OpenXR session, no mock one either — what `vr_backend none; vr_restart` used to be typed for.
The game says once, in the console, that the flag implied it (`startBackend`, `Quake/vr/vr_main.cpp`). Start the game
without the flag to play in a headset.

`vr_flatplay_status` (console, or Debug > Reports > Flatscreen Play Status) says whether the flag was given, whether a
headset session is up, and whether the mode is on.

## What the mode does

**The hands are tracked by the game, not by a headset.** The client marks the player's hands as tracked
(`QVR_BUTTON_HANDSTRACKED`, `Quake/vr/vr_client.cpp`), which is what lets the game run its VR gameplay for a flatscreen
player at all: held weapons, the force grab, melee, the holsters, body touches.

**The arms are posed by the game** (`flatplay::poseHands`, called from `Quake/vr/vr_hands.cpp` in place of the old
straight-out-in-front pose). The pose is built from the view angles, the weapon in each hand and the player's own motion:

- a held weapon sits out in front of the chest, on the centre line; an empty hand hangs at its side; the free hand
  rests near the other hand's gun;
- the hands are turned so the weapon in them shoots along the crosshair, whatever that weapon's Shot Pitch and Yaw
  (`aimRotAtCrosshair` inverts `weapons::shotAngles`); the drawn gun and its muzzle follow the hand, so the shot and the
  viewmodel agree;
- the whole pose is measured from the shoulders (`hands::bodyAnchor` with `vr_shoulder_offset`), so it follows the body
  whatever the height calibration; `vr_flat_reach` scales how far the hands sit from them.

**The hands are locked to the view.** The game's pose is rigid in the view's frame (only a change of pose — a weapon
taken, a punch, E's reach — is eased, in that frame). The hands are made at the frame's start, before the mouse turns the
view and before the client moves the player, so in this mode they are made again twice (`hands::relatch`, the frame's
velocities kept): for the move (`buildMove`: the shots go where the crosshair is now) and for the drawn view
(`VR_SetupViewEntities`: the origin just moved to). The drawn hands are then carried onto the camera as drawn (Quake's
view bob, strafe roll, kick and step easing). With the three looks below at 0 the drawn weapon does not move in the view
at all (0.014 units strafing and turning; it was 23.7 units strafing and 7.5 degrees at 540 degrees a second turning).

**The looks** are the drawn hands' only (`flatplay::drawnOffset`, added like the fatigue shake; the muzzle is put back on
the steady hand), so the shots and the aim stay on the crosshair whatever they are set to:

- **Move Sway** (`vr_flat_sway`, 1): each change of the player's velocity kicks the hands the other way and a spring
  settles them, a little overshoot: they lag as he starts and stops (~1.3 units), dip on a jump and on a landing. At a
  steady run they are where they rest;
- **Walk Bob** (`vr_flat_bob`, 1): a figure of eight on the ground, its size and rate with the speed (0.7 units across,
  0.6 down, a little roll at a run), and breathing at rest;
- **Turn Lag** (`vr_flat_turnlag`, 1) and **Turn Lag Recovery** (`vr_flat_turnlag_speed`, 1): "weapon inertia": the hands
  keep their direction as the view turns and a critically damped spring brings them back (18/s times the recovery).
  ~2 degrees behind at 180 degrees a second, at most 4 (softly), back within a quarter second. A view set in one frame
  (a teleporter, a respawn) leaves no lag.

These are plain (not saved) cvars, and they are in the Debug menu: **Debug > Reports > Flatscreen Play** — Status, Print
(`vr_flatplay_debug`: prints each E and V press and where the hands are; 2: each frame the drawn weapon in the camera's
frame, `flatview:`, and each move's shot against the view, `flatmove:`), Hand Reach, Move Sway, Walk Bob, Turn Lag, Turn
Lag Recovery. Test: `bash Misc/quakevr/flatplay_test.sh <agent>`.

**The keys.** Read from the keyboard state, not from bindings — nothing is rebound and no config changes; they only work
while the game has the keys (`key_dest == key_game`).

| Key | |
|---|---|
| mouse LMB | fires the right hand (as in VR) |
| mouse RMB | fires the left hand (as in VR) |
| `E` | force-grabs what the view is pointed at, with the free hand (`impulse 46` → `VR_Forcegrab_FlatGrab`; the search, the flight and the catch are the game's own force grab). With both hands holding weapons there is no hand to collect with and E does nothing. |
| `1` | cycles the **left** hand's weapon through the weapons collected |
| `2` | cycles the **right** hand's weapon |
| `V` | a punch with the right hand: a real motion of the hand (wound up, thrown, drawn back), so the game's own melee rules decide whether it lands |
| Left Ctrl | crouches while it is held, stands up as it is let go; `+flatcrouch` and `-flatcrouch` hold and release the same from the console (see Crouching below). Right Ctrl is the same key to the engine (`K_CTRL`: `Quake/in_sdl.c`) |
| `F` | switches the flashlight: the engine's own `vr_flashlight_toggle`; put out, it stays out (a level change and a saved game included) |
| `G` | lets go of what a hand holds, the main hand first and the off hand after (`impulse 47` → `VR_Forcegrab_FlatDrop`, `QC/vr_wpnforcegrab.qc`): a weapon out of the hand the way the game drops one, a box or a prop carried in it let go at his feet (physics again, free to take again); carried in both hands, one press frees both |

`1` and `2` go through the existing weapon cycling (`CycleWeaponCommand`, the controller's B and Y); `getWeaponCycleMode`
In this mode the cycle (1, 2 and the mouse wheel) also stops at the empty hand (the fist), both directions; VR cycling is unchanged.
returns ALLOWED while the mode is on, whatever `vr_weapon_cycle_mode` says. The other number keys keep Quake's own
weapon select.

**The hands are closed.** There is no grip to hold on the desktop, so a flatscreen hand reports its grip as pressed:
`gripping()` in `Quake/vr/vr_client.cpp` answers for the `QVR_VRBITS0_*HAND_GRABBING` bits and for `client::grabbing`
while the mode runs. The game's hold checks ask for that bit (`VRWeaponLetGo` in `QC/weapons.qc`, the carried thing's
upkeep in `QC/vr_carry.qc`), and with an open hand everything a flatscreen player is given leaves the hand on the frame
it arrives in. With it, what the mode puts in a hand stays there: `E` takes, `1` and `2` move weapons between the hands,
and a hand lets go of nothing by itself (`G` is the key for letting go).

**No reloading.** `VRIsWeaponReloadingEnabled` (`QC/vr_util.qc`) is off: a magazine is refilled from the reserve as it
empties, with no handling step.

**A box grabbed with `E` is taken at once.** `VR_Carry_AutoCollect` (`QC/vr_carry.qc`) follows `vr_carry_autocollect`, the
menu's Item Pickup Mode; for a player in the mode it counts as at least 1 — mode 1's collectable set, ammo and health
(backpacks are mode 2's) — whatever he has saved, since there is no hand-to-hand step on the screen to confirm a pickup. The
cvar itself is never written, so a headset player on the same save keeps what he set.

**Crouching (Left Ctrl).** `pollKeysFlat` (`Quake/vr/vr_flatplay.cpp`) reads Left Ctrl with `E`, `F` and `G` and eases one
number from 0 to 1 over `vr_flat_crouch_time`; `+flatcrouch` and `-flatcrouch` hold and release it from the console. That
number stands for `vr_flat_crouch_drop` units: `VR_FlatViewDrop` takes them off `r_refdef.vieworg` (`Quake/view.c`), and
`placeFlat` (`Quake/vr/vr_hands.cpp`) puts the head it poses, and `headHeight` with it, down the same, so the drawn body
follows the view. The pose's head goes over the move wire as any other head does, and the game's own crouching does the
rest: `hull::updateCrouch` (`Quake/vr/vr_hull.cpp`) chooses a crouched box for the eyes' new height (36 at the default 18,
out of `vr_crouch_height` and `vr_crouch_step`), the CROUCHED bit (23 of `vrBits0`) arrives as it does for a headset player
who crouches, and `crouchSpeedMax` slows him as it slows him there. Nothing is added to the move wire, and nothing new
collides: a crouch is not a jump. `.vr_stand` — how upright the game thinks he is, read by `QC/vr_kdtrig.qc` — is worked out
from the same numbers in `Quake/vr/vr_server.cpp`: 1 while he stands, less as he comes down (a headset player's value is
computed as it was). Outside the mode nothing moves: `crouchDrop()` answers 0 and `VR_FlatViewDrop` returns at once.

**The flashlight is worn on the head, and `F` switches it.** `vr_flashlight`'s "Always on Head" behaviour (`vr_flashlight 2`)
is what the mode stands in for: `enabled()` and `headMode()` in `Quake/vr/vr_flashlight.cpp` answer as they do for it. There
is no belt to reach for on the screen: the torch is worn at the temple and lit at a fresh start (`reset`). `F` sends the
engine's own `vr_flashlight_toggle`, and in the mode the state the engine saves each frame is left as it is when a game is
restored (`restoreState`): a torch put out with `F` stays out, over a level change. A headset game is as it was — its
restored state still forces the head-worn torch lit.

**The body presses the buttons it walks into.** `Quake/vr/vr_physics.cpp` lets a flatscreen player's body do the hand
touch it does for an untracked player, whatever `vr_body_interactions` says.

**Co-op: the mode is each player's own.** A client in the mode says so in its move (bit 15 of the VR block's
`vrBits0`, `protocol::moveFlatplayBit`); the server takes it out of the QC's bits and sets that player's
`.vr_flatscreen` (`Quake/vr/vr_server.cpp`). Every game-side gate asks for the player it is about (`VR_FlatPlay(player)`
in `QC/vr_util.qc`: reloading, `E`'s grab, `1` and `2`, the grip-less catch; the body's hand touch in
`vr_physics.cpp`). So a flatscreen host leaves reloading on for the VR players who join it, and a flatscreen client on a
VR host gets `E`, `1` and `2` and no reloading. The engine's `vr_flatplay` cvar is the local client's mode only (its
hands, its flashlight, its keys).

## Tuning

`vr_flat_reach` (1), `vr_flat_sway` (1), `vr_flat_bob` (1), `vr_flat_turnlag` (1), `vr_flat_turnlag_speed` (1) — all
not saved, all in the Debug menu. `vr_flat_crouch_time` (0.25) and `vr_flat_crouch_drop` (18), also not saved, are at the
console, and `vr_flatplay_status` prints them with what the keys did. The pose's own numbers (where a hand sits, how far
a punch throws the fist, how long it takes) are named constants at the top of `vr_flatplay.cpp`.
